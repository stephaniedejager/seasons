Focused on learning about the React State System and The Component Lifecycle

Learned how to 1) initialize a state - either inside the constructor or not 

and

Where it is best to 2) do initial data-loading (like location API request) - inside the componentDidMount().

Although you technically can do initial data-loading in the constructor(), it is best practice to do it in componentDidMount() - I also noticed that the location was returned faster when using the latter.

Used Semantic UI to show icons and a spinner

The spinner was implemented as a reusable component with a message prop, because we needed something custom.  Also included default.Props with a default message of Loading.

Basic CSS styling that changed depending on the season

To clean up the code we used a config function for the conditional logic and ES2015 to to extract the variables from the config object.

Refactored the conditional logic inside the render() function with a helper function renderContent() to make it more easily edible, but it slowed down the response on the screen.
